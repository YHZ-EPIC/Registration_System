## Steps to Run

    Step 1: Download and Install Xampp

<ul>
<li>Visit the official Xampp website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
</li>
<br>
<li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Xampp. Choose the components you want to install (Apache, MySQL, PHP, and PhpMyAdmin) during the installation process.
</li>
</ul>

    Step 2: Start Xampp Control Panel

<ul>
<li> 
Once the installation is complete, open the Xampp Control Panel <br> (you can find it in the installation directory or start menu).
</li>
<br>
<li>
Note : If you're on Windows, you might need to run the Control Panel as an administrator for certain actions.
</li>
</ul>

    Step 3: Start Apache and MySQL

<ul>
In the Xampp Control Panel, you will see the "Apache" and "MySQL" modules listed. <br>
Click the "Start" button next to "Apache" to start the Apache web server. <br>
Click the "Start" button next to "MySQL" to start the MySQL database server.
</ul>

    Step 4: Verify Apache and MySQL

<ul>
<li>
After starting Apache and MySQL, check the status in the Xampp Control Panel. <br> You should see "Running" next to both "Apache" and "MySQL" if they started successfully.
</li>
<br>
<li>
You can also verify if the servers are running by opening your web browser and <br> navigating to http://localhost/ - if you see the Xampp welcome page, it means Apache is working.
</li>
</ul>

    Step 5: Create a New Folder for Your Website

Create a new folder in the Xampp "htdocs" directory. By default, it is located at <br> "C:\xampp\htdocs" on Windows, <br> "/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs" on macOS, and <br> "/opt/lampp/htdocs" on Linux. <br>

Name the folder as you like; this will be the root folder for your website.

    Step 6: Copy This Github Repository Files to that Folder

Place all these files in this github repository in the folder <br> you created in the "htdocs" directory.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
<br> In PhpMyAdmin, find an option called "Import" and
Select the "anime.sql" file <br> provided in this repository.
The database will be imported.

    Step 7: Access Your Website

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your-folder-name/ <br> (replace "your-folder-name" with the name of the folder you created in step 5). <br> <br>
Your PHP/MySQL website should now be running, <br> and you can interact with it through the browser.

    Step 8: Managing Your Database with PhpMyAdmin

To manage your MySQL database, you can use PhpMyAdmin, <br> a web-based tool that comes with Xampp. <br>

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
<br> In PhpMyAdmin, you can create databases, tables, and manage your database content.

    Step 9: Stop Apache and MySQL

Click the "Stop" button next to "Apache" and "MySQL" 
to shut down the servers.
